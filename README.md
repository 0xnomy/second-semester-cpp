# Second Semester OOP Codes

This repo contains my second semester Object Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment at **GIKI**, taught by **Dr. Zahid Halim**. Here you'll find a collection of code, which I have collaborated on with my group partner, **Syed Abdul Rehman Hasan** (@manuwastaken)

These codes demonstrates our understanding of important OOP concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, and showcase our ability to implement them in practical applications. The code is easy to read and follow, making it an excellent resource for beginners to understand.

*If you are interested in trying out the polynomial addition program, head over to my Github repository at https://github.com/0xnomy/polynomial-addition-ds-cpp. There, you can find the necessary text files to run the program and see it in action. Give it a try and see how it works!*


Thank you for taking the time to visit my repository, and I hope you find our codes helpful and informative.
