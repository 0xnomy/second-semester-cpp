# Second Semester OOP Codes

This repo contains my second semester Object Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment at GIKI, taught by Dr. Zahid Halim. Here you'll find a collection of code, which I have collaborated on with my group partner, Syed Abdul Rehman Hasan - @manuwastaken

These codes demonstrates our understanding of important OOP concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, and showcase our ability to implement them in practical applications. The code is easy to read and follow, making it an excellent resource for beginners to understand.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my repository, and I hope you find our codes helpful and informative.
